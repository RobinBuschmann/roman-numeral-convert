# roman-numeral-converter
Converts integer numbers to roman numerals

## Why javascript/typescript?
Because it is my second big love. You can easily write less verbose declarative and also 
imperative code. No boilerplate. With typescript on top one can add the perfect portion
of type safety - You don't need to annotate everything with types, since typescript is
very strong in inferring types as well ❤️

## Installation
**Precondition**: node.js need to be installed
```bash
npm install
